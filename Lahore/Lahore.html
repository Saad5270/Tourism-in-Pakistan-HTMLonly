        <p>When we think of Lahore the most famous symbol that comes into our minds is Lahore fort. A fort existed at this location for a long time. But a much larger and stronger brick fort was constructed in 1575 by Akbar. The later Mughal emperors made more additions and embellished it further. Spread over an area of over 40 acres, this huge fort contains beautiful pavilions, buildings and lawns. The most famous among these are Sheesh Maha, Naulakha Pavilion, Moti Masjid, Diwan e Aam, Diwan e Khas, etc. The subterranean chambers are also a big attraction. Its museum, especially the Sikh Gallery is famous all over the world for its paintings, weapons and other artifacts from the Sikh era. A wonderful place to learn history and architecture of Lahore and have an interesting time with family. </p>

        <p>Right in front of the iconic Alamigiri gate of the Lahore Fort is located Badshahi Mosque of Lahore, a masterpiece of Mughal architecture. It was built during the reign of Aurangzeb between 1671 – 1673 AD. It is the most magnificent building in Lahore and complements the magnificence of the fort as well. Built over an area of more than 7 acres, makes it one of the largest and most beautiful mosques in the world. Its lofty minarets are visible from large parts of the city and its interior is exquisitely beautiful. One on a mission to explore Lahore cannot miss this place.</p>

        <p>Spread over an area of nearly 100 acres, this is the largest park in the city of Lahore and certainly the most important as well. It is located close to iconic landmarks of the city, the Lahore Fort and Badshahi mosque. It is this historic place, where the decision of struggling for an independent and separate country for Muslims was made in 1940. In the memory of that historic event a beautiful minaret has been constructed, known as Minar e Pakistan. The writer of Pakistan’s national anthem, the famous poet Hafeez Jalandhari is also buried here. A great place to sit and walk or enjoy some time, while enjoying the view of imposing Lahore Fort, magnificent Badshahi mosque and historic gurdwaras and smadhi of Ranjit Singh nearby.  </p>

        <p>Jehangir is the only Mughal emperor who is buried inside Pakistan. He died in 1627 on his return from Kashmir and was buried here in a garden, named Dilkusha. The construction started after his burial and took ten years to build. The vast garden around this elegantly built mausoleum is very beautiful. The interior is decorated with frescoes and artwork of tiles and glass. Its beauty and tranquillity makes it a nice place to have a picnic with family. The tomb of his wife Queen Noor Jehan, is located nearby, an added attraction. </p>
