        <p>Pakistan is a country which Allah Almighty has given a diverse geography and diverse climate. Pakistan has different people, different languages and regions that make Pakistan a home of many colours. Pakistan has deserts, lush green areas, plains, mountains, forests, cold and hot areas, beautiful lakes, islands and much more. That is why Pakistan attracted 1 million tourists in 2012. Due to the law and order situation, tourism in Pakistan has been severely affected, but now the situation has returned to normal and in good numbers. People have turned to Pakistan.The biggest boost to tourism in Pakistan came in the 1970s when the country was booming and like other industries, tourism in Pakistan was also booming. Millions of tourists from abroad used to come to Pakistan.
            Pakistan's most popular tourist destinations included the Khyber Pass, Peshawar, Karachi, Lahore, Swat and Rawalpindi. Over time, other beautiful areas of the country were introduced around the world and tourism in Pakistan grew rapidly. That is why today hundreds of tourist destinations are visited in the country, especially in the northern regions of Pakistan tourism is on the rise. The northern areas include Azad Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and northwestern Punjab. There are many views of nature in the northern part of Pakistan. Along with this, there are various forts, historical places, archeological sites, valleys, rivers, streams, forests, lakes and many more. The southern regions of Pakistan are also attractive to tourists. The beautiful dry mountains of Balochistan, Ziarat, Quetta and Gwadar are exemplary. The coast of Sindh, Karachi, Mukli Cemetery, Gorakh Hill Station Dadu, Thar Desert, Moenjodaro and many towns and villages have a special place in tourism due to their beautiful and historical background. The historic city of Multan in southern Punjab, the Cholistan Desert in Bahawalpur and the beautiful Fort Monroe in Dera Ghazi Khan District are also of tourist importance.</p>
